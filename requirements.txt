# Note: Some packages like 'pickle', 'json', 'logging', 'threading', 'concurrent.futures', 
# 'multiprocessing', 'os', 'sys', 'time', 'datetime', 'collections', 'functools', 're' 
# are part of Python's standard library and don't need to be installed separately.

# Installation instructions:
# 1. Basic installation:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# 2. For GPU acceleration (if NVIDIA GPU available):
#    pip install faiss-gpu>=1.7.0
#    (instead of faiss-cpu)
#
# 3. For development:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#    pip install pytest pytest-cov jupyter
#
# 4. Minimum Python version: 3.8+
#
# 5. Recommended system requirements:
#    - RAM: 4GB+ (8GB+ for semantic search)
#    - Storage: 2GB+ for models and indexes
#    - CPU: Multi-core recommended for parallel processing

# Platform-specific notes:
# - Windows: May need Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools for some packages
# - macOS: May need Xcode command line tools
# - Linux: Usually works out of the box with most distributions

# Model downloads (automatic on first use):
# - PhoBERT model: ~400MB (vinai/phobert-base)
# - underthesea models: ~100MB (Vietnamese NER models)
# These will be downloaded automatically when first used.

# Optional optimizations:
# - For faster CSV processing: pip install pyarrow>=5.0.0
# - For better memory management: pip install memory-profiler>=0.60.0
# - For advanced text processing: pip install spacy>=3.4.0
